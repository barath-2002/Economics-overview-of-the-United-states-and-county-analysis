# Economics-overview-of-the-United-states-and-county-analysis

Introduction:

Welcome to our project focused on providing a high-level overview of the US economy during the years 2012-2017. The economy of the United States is vast and complex, making it a challenging but fascinating subject for analysis. In this repository, we aim to conduct descriptive analysis to gain insights into key aspects of the US economy during this period. Our analysis serves as a foundation for deeper research into specific economic phenomena, providing a platform to ask more targeted questions and explore narrow areas of interest.

Objective:

The primary objective of our exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to understand the state of the US economy across various dimensions. We focus on several key areas:

Review of General Economic Features: Providing an overview of the US economy by examining key population figures and trends, setting the stage for further analysis.

Rural vs Urban County Review: Differentiating between rural and urban counties in the US, exploring how economic factors vary across these regions and understanding the distribution of different types of counties.

PCA & County Clustering: Applying principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering to US county data to identify natural clusters within the dataset, beyond the predefined clusters based on population density or wealth.

Wealth Analysis of the US: Analyzing geographical trends related to wealth per capita distributions in the US, including the division of counties into different wealth quantiles. Additionally, exploring rental prices to gain insights into the housing market.
